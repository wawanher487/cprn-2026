        The SEAMEO Centre Policy Research Network (CPRN) Summit 2026 will be
        convened in Jakarta, Indonesia, the nation’s capital and a regional hub
        for policy dialogue, research, and innovation. As reflected in the image
        of the National Monument (Monumen Nasional/Monas), Jakarta stands as a
        powerful symbol of unity, resilience, and the collective aspiration
        toward an inclusive and sustainable future. Serving as the host city,
        Jakartaoffers a dynamic environment where research, policy, and practice
        intersect, making it a fitting setting for the CPRN Summit 2026 themed
        “Bridging Research, Policy, and Practice: Pathways toward an Inclusive,
        Equitable, and Sustainable Futures.” The city’s strategic role in
        Southeast Asia, combined with its modern infrastructure and rich
        socio-cultural landscape, provides an enabling platform for meaningful
        regional collaboration. The CPRN Summit 2026 will bring together
        researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and development partners from
        across Southeast Asia to engage in evidence-informed
        dialogue,cross-sectoral learning, and collaborative action. Anchored in
        the spirit of inclusivity and equity, the forum seeks to translate
        research into policies and practices that respond to the lived realities
        of diverse communities, paving the way toward sustainable and just
        futures for the region.
